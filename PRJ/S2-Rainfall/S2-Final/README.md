"You, a satellite, are floating around this planet called Earth.

Your creators, Humans, are a brilliant yet foolish, arrogant and egocentric species.

Everything was calm, until the 'rain' started falling.

And then, it was silence."

This is a simulation attempting to create the perspective of something 'out of this world'
when the human species annihilates itself in an all-out nuclear Warfare.

The context is minimal; because too much word will simply ruin the mood.
The visuals is minimal; because the aesthetic is meant to be dehumanized, just like the senseless and weightless casualty numbers.
The interactivity is minimal; because you're no God, there's nothing you can do other than accepting the pending Doom.

So much ideas were contemplated, tried, but never came into fruition.
If I was more capable, I would have done much more.
As for now, I am satisfied.
